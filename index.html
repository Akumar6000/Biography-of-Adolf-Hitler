        <h2>Childhood and eduction</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">
          Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in
          Austria-Hungary (present-day Austria), close to the border with the
          German Empire. He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler
          and his third wife, Klara Pölzl. Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav,
          Ida, and Otto—died in infancy. Also living in the household were
          Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and
          Angela (born 1883). When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau,
          Germany. There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect,
          rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his
          life. The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894,
          and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he
          farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded
          primary school) in nearby Fischlham.

        <h2>Military Career of Adolf Hitler</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">
          The greatest of all experiences, and was praised by his commanding
          officers for his bravery. His wartime experience reinforced his German
          patriotism, and he was shocked by Germanys capitulation in November
          1918. His displeasure with the collapse of the war effort began to
          shape his ideology. Like other German nationalists, he believed the
          Dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the
          German army, undefeated in the field, had been stabbed in the back on
          the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, Marxists, and those who
          signed the armistice that ended the fighting—later dubbed the november
          criminals.

        <h2>Politic view of Hitler</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">
          After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich. Without formal education
          or career prospects, he remained in the Army. In July 1919, he was
          appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an
          Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned
          to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers'
          Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman
          Anton Drexler was impressed by Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave him
          a copy of his pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained
          anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas. On
          the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party,
          and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began
          counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much
          larger party).

        <h2>Death of Adolf Hilter</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">
          Adolf Hitler, chancellor and dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to
          1945, committed suicide via a gunshot to the head on 30 April 1945 in
          the Führerbunker in Berlin after it became clear that Germany would
          lose the Battle of Berlin, which led to the end of World War II in
          Europe. Eva Braun, his wife of one day, also committed suicide by
          cyanide poisoning. In accordance with Hitler's prior written and
          verbal instructions, that afternoon their remains were carried up the
          stairs and through the bunker's emergency exit to the Reich
          Chancellery garden, where they were doused in petrol and burned. The
          news of Hitler's death was announced on German radio the next day, 1
          May.
